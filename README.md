# python_challenge
In this challenge you will find two python codes: 1- Pypoll.py 2- PyBank.py

Pypoll.py reads election_data.csv which has information of a small rural town vote. This code reads this information and finds the total number of votes. It also finds the winner by counting each candidate number of votes. In the analysis folder you will find the output of these results in notepad as well as a screenshot of the GitBash outputs.

PyBank.py reads the budget_data.csv which is composed of profit/loss of a company over 86 months. This code reads this information and finds total profit/loss of this company as well as the maximum increase/Decrease in profit per month. In the analysis folder you will find the output of these results in notepad as well as a screenshot of the GitBash outputs.

Both of these codes use Python and csv module. They read the csv file as a list in a for loop and store the information in separate lists. A counter will count the total and a write function export the results into a text file.
